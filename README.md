Our single-page application is intended to help users of Cuisine Solutions meal service easily find the heating instructions for their meals. Utilizing a json server, we have applied functionality to search, filter and favorite meal results. 

This application utilizes five distinct Event Listeners: click, mouseover, mouseleave, change and submit.
